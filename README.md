## C WebServer
Hi, I was tired of not understanding what I was doing while learning C by developping a RayCaster..
So instead I choose something that should help me understand the tools and how to work with a Unix system.

This project while be developped in C only with a Linux kernel (Ubuntu 25.0.X).

To run the project, you just need cmake and the gcc compiler.
Create a new folder to store the build and the make configuration
```bash
mkdir bin
cd bin
```

Then run the CMake configuration to generate the project and start it up
```bash
cmake ..
make
./webserver
```

Wish me luck and patience :D
